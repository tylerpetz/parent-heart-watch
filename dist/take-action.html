				<h3>You Can Help Us Eliminate Preventable Death from Sudden Cardiac Arrest in Youth</h3>
				<p>Sudden Cardiac Arrest (SCA) is the leading cause of death in the U.S., taking the lives of 600,000 annually, according to the Institute of Medicine. But what most parents don’t know is that SCA is the #1 killer of student athletes and the #2 medical cause of death among youth under 25.</p>
	
				<p>The vision of Parent Heart Watch is to eliminate preventable deaths from sudden cardiac arrest in youth by 2030. Our mission is to lead and empower communities to save young hearts by providing the critical education and tools necessary to champion prevention in your home, at your school, on your team and throughout your community. </p>
	
				<p><strong>We call this national movement Operation Prevention.</strong></p>

					<strong>Take the Prevention Promise</strong>
					5 To Stay Alive
				</p>
	
				<p>You can literally save a life by taking The Prevention Promise and utilizing the 5 to Stay Alive Toolkit. Read on for tools you can use now, and sign up to receive the latest information that will keep you up to date on how you can stay a part of this national movement to champion sudden cardiac arrest prevention.</p>
	
				<p>One of the biggest misconceptions about sudden cardiac arrest is that “it just happens” and there’s nothing you can do to stop it. The truth is that sudden cardiac arrest IS preventable—but that doesn’t happen by chance. <br/>Take 5 to Stay Alive and learn what you can do to save a life.</p>
	
				<div class="text-left">
					<img src="assets/img/step1.png" alt="5 To Stay Alive" class="centered-img">
	
					<p>The first step in prevention is to determine any risk factors already present in your child’s life. Evaluate your family’s heart history and assess your child for warning signs and unrecognized symptoms of a potential heart condition. It’s important to involve your child in this assessment. Don’t just assume you know answer to the question simply because your child never mentioned possible symptoms—they may be living with a chronic condition they simply don’t recognize as unusual.</p>
	
					<p>Whether risk factors are apparent or not, take time to educate yourself about sudden cardiac arrest and how it differs from a heart attack.</p>
	
					<a href="#" class="tools">TOOLS <span>	&#9654;</span></a>
	
					<img src="assets/img/step2.png" alt="5 To Stay Alive" class="centered-img">
	
					<p>It’s a fact that primary and secondary sudden cardiac arrest prevention strategies save lives. Heart screenings are not a part of standard check-ups or pre-participation sports physicals, even though many heart conditions have no or unrecognized warning signs. In fact, the first symptom could be death. Getting your child’s heart screened is a quick, painless and noninvasive assessment that can reveal potential problems. Find a screening provided in your community, or ask your doctor to order one.</p>
	
					<p>Everyone should know the Cardiac Chain of Survival. It’s a simple, step-by-step guide to save a life. Because every minute counts for a sudden cardiac arrest victim, and emergency responders are typically up to 12 minutes away, taking immediate action will be the difference between life and death.</p>
	
					<a href="#" class="tools">TOOLS <span>	&#9654;</span></a>
	
					<img src="assets/img/step3.png" alt="5 To Stay Alive" class="centered-img">
	
					<p>The only way we can truly eliminate preventable deaths from sudden cardiac arrest is if each of us champions the cause in our community. You can talk to your school or school district about acquiring more AEDs, and being sure the AEDs they have are unlocked and accessible during school events. Compel your school, team, camp, childcare center and any other youth-focused organization to implement a Cardiac Emergency Response Plan. Advocate for CPR training for students, educators, athletic personnel and anyone involved with youth.</p>
	
					<p>Then, go viral! Use your online email chains, newsletters, blogs, web pages and social media portals to post and share about how everyone can become a sudden cardiac arrest prevention champion.</p>
	
					<a href="#" class="tools">TOOLS <span>	&#9654;</span></a>
	
					<img src="assets/img/step4.png" alt="5 To Stay Alive" class="centered-img">
	
					<p>Coaches, camp counselors, daycare providers and many others have a front seat to what’s happening with your child during daily physical activity. Be sure to talk to your them about potential warning signs or risk factors you’ve discovered in your child, or any they’ve observed. For example, after a season of training, your child should not be continually out of breath. Ask if an AED is present — on the field during practices and games, near the playground, or anywhere else kids congregate, and if not, what’s the gameplan on how to get one. Advocate for these youth leaders to be trained in the potential warning signs of SCA and in the cardiac chain of survival.</p>

					<p>Because sudden cardiac arrest prevention is not a standard part of youth health care, it’s important to talk to your doctor about potential warning signs and risk factors, as well as getting a baseline heart screening for your child whether risk factors are present or not—especially if he or she is active. Take the cardiac questionnaire to your appointment to start the conversation. International guidelines recommend a cardiac screening every other year through age 25 as heart conditions can develop or change as young hearts grow.</p>
