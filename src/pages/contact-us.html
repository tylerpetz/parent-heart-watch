				<p><em>For Parents Of A Child Who Has Survived Sudden Cardiac Arrest</em>
					Though surviving Sudden Cardiac Arrest is an outcome to celebrate, many youth and their families are overwhelmed by the trauma of the experience and appreciate the opportunity to connect with others who share this unique perspective. The Parent Heart Watch community includes parents of SCA survivors and young survivors themselves who have navigated their recovery through relationships, education and action.
