			<h3>OPERATION PREVENTION</h3>
			<p>Parent Heart Watch is a dynamic and transformative platform that cultivates courageous champions by transitioning them from debilitating grief, or by marshaling the power of their survivorship, and empowers them to create life-saving community programs. It is singular in its role as the only national voice dedicated to sudden cardiac arrest prevention in youth. Our comprehensive education and compelling best practice models have inspired the creation of life-saving primary and secondary prevention programs in over 100 communities across the nation, impacting hundreds of thousands of youth, parents, educators, athletic directors, coaches and allied health professionals.</p>

			<p>Overall, our organization has cultivated well over 1,500 champions advocating for youth SCA prevention in 39 states, from AED placement and CPR training, to low or no-cost youth heart screenings, to presentations and education material distribution. Central to our outreach is Heart to Heart—an annual live program that fuels the creation and evolution of community programs and local advocates, which is supported by important outreach campaigns that continue to drive prevention activities throughout each year.</p>

			<p>We refer to this national movement of sudden cardiac arrest prevention in youth as <strong>Operation Prevention</strong>, and its consciousness is perpetuated through three initiatives:</p>

			<p>• We cultivate local champions throughout the nation who create community programs that drive the groundswell of demand for SCA prevention.</p>

			<p>• We architect collaborations that convert passive heart safety protocol in youth education, sports and medical communities into proactive prevention strategies.</p>

			<p>• We motivate parents to engage in neighborhood prevention (doctors, coaches, schools, friends and family) to advance their own child's well-being.<br/><br/></p>
