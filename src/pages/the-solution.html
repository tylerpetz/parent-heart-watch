			<p>Death from sudden cardiac arrest can often be prevented through wide- spread education about this silent killer and committed implementation of primary and secondary prevention strategies. </p>

			<h5>Early detection is crucial.</h5>
			<p>Youth are not adequately screened for heart conditions. In fact, the standard approach to physical exams and patient histories misses 96% of youth at risk for sudden cardiac arrest (SCA). Parent Heart Watch advocates for <a href="#">heart screenings</a> in youth for the early detection of risk factors and conditions associated with SCA. </p>

			<p>Because most heart conditions that can lead to SCA are not detectable with a stethoscope, a simple, noninvasive and painless test with an EKG and echocardiogram, a comprehensive review of personal and family heart history and the proper assessment and follow-up of warning signs and symptoms are the best tools for primary prevention. Approximately 2% of youth that are heart-screened are diagnosed with a heart abnormality or concern, while 1% are diagnosed with a life-threatening heart condition. As children grow their hearts change and repeat evaluations are recommended through age 25. </p>

			<h5 class="yellow">AEDs Everywhere!</h5>
			<p>U.S. News &amp; World Report reported that 70% of Americans either don’t know or have forgotten how to administer CPR—an alarming statistic, given one quarter of Americans say they’ve been in a situation when someone needed CPR.And every minute’s delay in emergency treatment decreases the chances of survival by 10%.</p>

			<p>Most occurrences of SCA in youth occur in public places.  The increased availability of publicly accessible <a href="#">automated external defibrillators (AEDs)</a> in schools and school-sponsored athletic events will dramatically increase the probability that youth will survive SCA. Knowing and properly executing the critically time-urgent links of the <a href="#">Cardiac Chain of Survival</a> can help save the life of a youth in SCA.  </p>

			<p>Further, a written <a href="#">Cardiac Emergency Response Plan (CERP)</a> is recommended for every school, sports team, camp and organization that works directly with children. A well-practiced CERP is a critical component of being prepared in case of a cardiac emergency. </p>

			<p>Evidence shows that schools with AEDs and emergency action plans have a survival rate of up to 64% (versus the national statistic of a mere 8%). We must demand that AEDs are in our schools and youth centers, and that communities are effectively trained in the cardiac chain of survival. Ultimately, a mandatory and systematic national registry documenting the incidence of sudden cardiac arrest in the young is critical to the development of prevention protocol in youth health care.</p>
