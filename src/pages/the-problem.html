			<h4>IT'S NOT RARE</h4>
			<p>Sudden Cardiac Arrest (SCA) is the leading cause of death in the U.S., taking the lives of 600,000 annually, according to the Institute of Medicine. But what most parents don’t know is that SCA is the #1 killer of studentathletes and the #2 medical cause of death among youth under 25.</p>

			<h5>So why are we often led to believe that SCA in youth is “too rare” to worry about?</h5>
			<p>The precise incidence of SCA in youth is presently unknown due to the lack of a mandatory and systematic national registry of SCA/SCD in youth. Various studies have been conducted on the incidence of Sudden Cardiac Arrest in youth, however, they have been based on different criteria and therefore produced different results.</p>

			<p>While there are many competing estimations on the number of sudden cardiac arrests annually, the American Heart Association reports that <strong>9,500 youth are affected</strong> by what the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute calls a critical public health issue. One student athlete dies every three days – it’s the leading cause of death on school campuses.</p>

			<p>SCA is not a heart attack – it’s an electrical or structural problem that causes a fatal arrhythmia – a deadly heartbeat. The underlying condition is something you’re born with (often inherited) and/or can develop as young hearts grow. The first symptom of SCA is often death, either because the warning signs of an underlying heart condition were not recognized or help was not administered within minutes of the event. In fact, <strong>up to 95% of SCA victims die</strong> because there was a delay in emergency response.</p>

			<p>Of the leading causes of youth death (accidents, suicide, homicide, cancer and heart conditions), sudden cardiac arrest is the only one that can be prevented through primary and secondary prevention strategies.</p>
