			<h3>TOGETHER WE CAN MAKE A GREATER DIFFERENCE.</h3>
			<p>Sudden Cardiac Arrest is the #1 killer of student athletes and the #2 medical cause of death in youth under 25. But of the leading causes of youth death (accidents, homicide, suicide, cancer and heart conditions), sudden cardiac arrest is the only one that can be prevented through primary and secondary prevention strategies.</p>

			<p>So the question is, if we can prevent the tragedy of losing a child, why don’t we? With at least 9,500 youth affected annually, there’s no time to waste &mdash; <strong>we must take action now.</strong></p>

			<p>Parent Heart Watch (PHW) invites you to be a part of the solution by supporting our vision to eliminate preventable deaths and disabilities from sudden cardiac arrest in youth by 2030. As a nonprofit and tax-exempt organization under the 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, your tax deductible donations will enable PHWto continue advocating for improved early detection of heart conditions that can lead to SCA and improved emergency protective measures should sudden cardiac arrest occur. These initiatives will save thousands of young lives each year. </p>
